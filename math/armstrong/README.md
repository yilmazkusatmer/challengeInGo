This exercise deals with three-digit Armstrong numbers. By definition, these are numbers for whose digits x, y and z from 1 to 9 the following equation applies:
<br />
xyz = x<sup>3</sup>+y<sup>3</sup>+z<sup>3</sup>`

For example:<br/> 
153 = 1 * 100 + 5 * 10 + 3 = 1<sup>3</sup> + 5<sup>3</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup>  = 153 
<br /> 
<br />
371 = 3 * 100 + 7 * 10 + 1 = 3<sup>3</sup> + 7<sup>3</sup> + 1<sup>3</sup>  = 371
