Perfect number is a number of the sum of its real devisors.  
For example for the numbers 6 and 28 it's true:

```6 = 3 + 2 +1``` 

```28 = 14 + 7 + 4 + 2 + 1```

| Value |           Result |
|-------|-----------------:|
| 6     |                6 |
| 1000  |       6, 28, 496 |
| 10000 | 6, 28, 496, 8128 |
